## Key Findings

### 1. **Google Gemini's Rapid Enterprise Adoption**

Google's Gemini platform appears in 405 documented use cases, representing the fastest adoption curve of any major AI platform in recent history. The multimodal capabilities (combining vision, voice, and text) are driving adoption across retail personalization, customer service, and content generation.

**Key applications:**
- Retail & E-commerce: 45 documented cases in personalization and recommendations
- Customer service: Conversational AI handling millions of interactions
- Content creation: Multimodal generation for marketing and media

**Competitive context:** This positions Gemini as a credible challenger to Microsoft's enterprise AI dominance, which remains strong at 767 documented deployments (25.4% of cases) but is growing more slowly.
