# Excluded Use Cases

This folder contains **cases that did not make the cut** for the final dataset.  
As of **v1.0**, there are **690 cases** in this archive.

---

## 📌 Why are cases excluded?
Cases may be excluded for one or more of the following reasons:
- ❌ **Not truly AI** (e.g., plain analytics, RPA without ML, generic automation).
- 🔁 **Duplicate** (same case listed multiple times or overlapping sources).
- ⚠️ **Insufficient detail** (no clear description, tools, or outcomes).
- 🌐 **Broken source** (404 or inaccessible link).
- 📝 **Marketing fluff** with no verifiable implementation details.

---

## 🆔 CaseIDs
- Excluded CaseIDs: **aicase-x0001 → aicase-x0690**.
- IDs are permanent — excluded cases remain visible here for transparency.

---

## 🧾 Purpose
This archive is maintained for:
- **Transparency**: showing the editorial process behind curation.
- **Research value**: allowing others to study the “gray area” of vendor case studies.
- **Version control**: ensuring CaseIDs are never reused or lost.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- These cases are **not included in the main library** because they are duplicates, non-AI, insufficiently detailed, or inaccessible.
- They should not be treated as valid AI use cases, but may be useful for **meta-analysis** (or if you're interested in researching non-AI use cases).

## 🙌 Contributions
If you believe an excluded case was wrongly classified:
- Open a **Correction Issue** and provide reasoning + source details.  
- Cases may be reconsidered for inclusion in future releases.

See [docs/contributing.md](../docs/contributing.md) for guidelines.
