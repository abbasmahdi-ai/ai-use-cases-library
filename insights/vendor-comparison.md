# Vendor Presence in Documented AI Use Cases

We analyzed 2,260 documented enterprise AI use cases. Vendor presence was measured two ways:  

1. **Tool/Technology mentions** ‚Üí where a vendor‚Äôs products appear in the Tool/Technology column.  
   - Captures multi-vendor adoption.  
   - Shows technical footprint across use cases.  

2. **Source (Publisher)** ‚Üí who published the case study.  
   - Reflects marketing and publication bias.  
   - Vendors like Microsoft and AWS publish far more case studies than others.  

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** See the [README note on vendor presence](../README.md) for methodology and limitations.  
> These figures represent the *share of documented case studies in our dataset*, not true global adoption. Vendors with larger publication pipelines (e.g., Microsoft, AWS) may appear overrepresented.
