aicase-02261,30MHz,30MHz Case Study,"30MHz has built a smart agriculture solution which provides growers with real-time remote crop monitoring solutions to help them optimise irrigation and ventilation, prevent disease or sunscald, improve pest management or predict shelf life. 30MHz and AWS Prototyping team co-developed a prototype to modernise this solution on a serverless architecture with AWS IoT Core and AWS Greengrass to process greenhouse data from the sensors on a local gateway device and continue the operations even offline with intermittent connectivity. In the next step, a machine learning pipeline was built with Amazon SageMaker, to help growers take decisions on climate and irrigation in order to provide optimal growing conditions for their crops. This includes predictive models for each individual grower, based on sensor data collected from each greenhouse, or providing benchmark models for new growers with no data. The prototyped solution is currently being tested by 8 pilot growers with the hopes of scaling up to 100s, even 1000s of growers in the near future.",,,,,,,https://youtu.be/sngtHh1iVaY?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card,AWS,"v0.2, v0.3",In-Review
