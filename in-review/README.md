# In-Review Use Cases

This folder contains **use cases that are pending review** for possible inclusion in the final dataset.  
As of **v2.0**, there are **78 cases** in this stage.

---

## 📌 What does "in-review" mean?
- These cases have been collected from credible sources, but:
  - They may be missing enrichment (detailed description, outcomes, tools).
  - Their industry/domain classification may need validation.
  - Their source may not yet be fully verified.
- They are **not yet scored** and should not be considered part of the production-quality dataset.

---

## 🆔 CaseIDs
- In-review cases are no longer in sequential order due to quality reviews and reclassifications.
- Once validated, cases are moved into the **final dataset** (`/data/use-cases.csv`) in a future release.  
- If they do not meet criteria, they are moved to `/excluded`.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- Use this dataset with caution - is is a **work-in-progress** and **not production quality**.
- It may contain incomplete information, missing enrichment, or unverified classifications.  
- Use it for background reference only. You should rely primarily on the **final dataset** (`/data/use-cases.csv`) for quality-controlled results.

## 🙌 Contributions
If you’d like to help improve these cases:
- Open a **Correction Issue** if you see errors.
- Suggest enrichment (tools, outcomes, better descriptions) via a **New Use Case Issue**.
